This project consists of two Java programs designed to manage student records:

## Task 1: Writing Student Records to File

**Description:**
The `writingStudentRecordstoFile` class collects student records from the user and writes them to a file named "eOnushilonStudentList.txt". It prompts the user to input details such as student ID, name, batch, semester, and phone number for a total of nine students. Using a `Formatter`, it formats and writes the entered information to the specified file.

## Task 2: Reading Student Records from File

**Description:**
The `readingStudentRecordsFromFile` class reads student records from the "eOnushilonStudentList.txt" file generated by the previous task. It retrieves the stored information, including student ID, name, batch, semester, and phone number, from the file. Using a `Scanner`, it reads each record and prints it to the console. This task facilitates the retrieval and display of student information stored in the file.

### How to Use:

1. Compile and run `writingStudentRecordstoFile.java` to input student records.
2. Compile and run `readingStudentRecordsFromFile.java` to read and display student records.
